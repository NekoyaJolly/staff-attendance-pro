# Automated Backup Retention Policies Documentation

## Overview

This comprehensive backup retention system provides automated, policy-driven backup management for the time tracking application with advanced retention policies, compliance features, and emergency procedures.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Enhanced Backup System** (`backup-system-enhanced.sh`)
   - Hierarchical backup scheduling (hourly/daily/weekly/monthly/yearly)
   - Intelligent backup type detection based on schedule
   - Compression and integrity verification
   - Metadata tracking and checksum validation

2. **Retention Policy Manager** (`backup-retention-policy.sh`)
   - Automated retention policy enforcement
   - Configurable retention periods by backup type
   - Archive management for compliance
   - Storage optimization through compression

3. **Emergency Cleanup System** (`emergency-cleanup.sh`)
   - Automatic disk space monitoring
   - Emergency cleanup when storage thresholds exceeded
   - Critical data preservation during emergencies
   - Multi-tier cleanup strategies

4. **Backup Audit System** (`backup-audit.sh`)
   - Comprehensive backup inventory auditing
   - Integrity verification and corruption detection
   - Retention policy compliance checking
   - Automated compliance reporting

## Retention Policies

### Standard Retention Periods

| Backup Type | Retention Period | Storage Location | Compression |
|-------------|------------------|------------------|-------------|
| Hourly      | 24 hours        | /var/backups     | gzip        |
| Daily       | 30 days         | /var/backups     | gzip        |
| Weekly      | 12 weeks        | /var/backups     | gzip        |
| Monthly     | 12 months       | /var/backups     | gzip        |
| Yearly      | 7 years         | /var/backups     | gzip        |

### Compliance Retention

| Data Type        | Retention Period | Justification           |
|------------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| Employee Records | 10 years        | Legal compliance        |
| Payroll Data     | 10 years        | Tax law requirements    |
| Attendance Logs  | 7 years         | Labor law compliance    |
| System Logs      | 90 days         | Security monitoring     |

### Archive Management

- **Automatic Archiving**: Backups older than 6 months moved to archive storage
- **Archive Location**: `/var/archives/timetracking/`
- **Archive Compression**: Additional compression for long-term storage
- **Archive Verification**: Monthly integrity checks on archived data

## Backup Schedule

### Automated Scheduling

```bash
# Hourly backups - every hour
0 * * * * /usr/local/bin/backup-system-enhanced.sh

# Daily retention cleanup - 1:00 AM
0 1 * * * /usr/local/bin/backup-retention-policy.sh

# Weekly health check - 6:00 AM Monday
0 6 * * 1 /usr/local/bin/backup-health-check.sh

# Monthly audit - 7:00 AM 1st of month
0 7 1 * * /usr/local/bin/backup-audit.sh

# Emergency cleanup - every 6 hours
0 */6 * * * /usr/local/bin/emergency-cleanup.sh
```

### Backup Type Determination

The system automatically determines backup type based on timing:

- **Hourly**: Default for all executions
- **Daily**: Executed at 2:00 AM
- **Weekly**: Sunday at 3:00 AM
- **Monthly**: 1st of month at 4:00 AM
- **Yearly**: January 1st at 5:00 AM

## Emergency Procedures

### Disk Space Emergency

1. **Warning Threshold**: 90% disk usage
   - Remove oldest hourly backups beyond preservation period
   - Send warning notifications

2. **Critical Threshold**: 95% disk usage
   - Remove oldest daily backups beyond preservation period
   - Remove oldest weekly backups if necessary
   - Send critical alerts

3. **Preservation Rules**:
   - Always preserve last 7 days of backups
   - Never delete monthly/yearly backups without manual intervention
   - Protect critical compliance data

### Backup Failure Recovery

1. **Automatic Retry**: Failed backups retry once after 30 minutes
2. **Notification**: Immediate alerts for backup failures
3. **Fallback**: Manual backup procedures documented
4. **Recovery**: Automated restore testing monthly

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Health Monitoring

- **Container Health**: Backup service status monitoring
- **Disk Usage**: Continuous space monitoring
- **Backup Success**: Verification of each backup operation
- **Integrity Checks**: Regular corruption detection

### Alert Levels

1. **INFO**: Routine operations and successful backups
2. **WARNING**: Non-critical issues (high disk usage, minor failures)
3. **CRITICAL**: System failures requiring immediate attention
4. **EMERGENCY**: Data loss risks or system compromise

### Notification Channels

- **Log Files**: All events logged to `/var/log/backup-*.log`
- **Email Alerts**: Critical issues sent to administrators
- **Health Status**: Real-time status in `/var/lib/backup-health.status`
- **Audit Reports**: Monthly compliance reports
