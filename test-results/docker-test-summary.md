### 🔧 Technical Implementation

#### Multi-Stage Docker Builds
```dockerfile
# Development/Test Stage
FROM node:18-alpine AS test-builder
- Installs all dependencies including dev tools
- Runs linting and type checking
- Executes unit tests during build
- Includes Playwright for E2E testing

# Production Stage  
FROM nginx:alpine AS production
- Optimized for production deployment
- Includes only built assets
- Security-hardened nginx configuration
- Health checks implemented
```

#### Test Environment Architecture
```yaml
services:
  frontend-test:    # React app with test runners
  backend-test:     # Node.js API with test data
  database-test:    # PostgreSQL with test fixtures
  redis-test:       # In-memory Redis for testing
  e2e-tests:        # Playwright test runner
  performance-test: # Load testing with sitespeed.io
```

#### Production Environment Architecture
```yaml
services:
  frontend:         # Nginx + optimized React build
  backend:          # Node.js API with production config
  database:         # PostgreSQL with persistence
  redis:            # Redis with session storage
  prometheus:       # Metrics collection
  grafana:          # Monitoring dashboards
```
